# 🦅 FocusPet: A Proof-of-Discipline Companion

> **"Train your focus. Raise your future."**

**FocusPet** is a Farcaster-native creature collection game where your digital pet evolves based on your _real-world discipline_. It leverages the **Celo blockchain** for fast, low-cost interactions and **GoodDollar (G$)** for a sustainable reward economy.

## 🎮 Core Mechanics

### 1. The Focus Loop (Proof-of-Discipline)

Your pet feeds on your focus. The more you work/study/read, the stronger it gets.

- **Start Session:** Open the Frame, set a timer (10m, 25m, 60m).
- **Stay Focused:** Keep the session active. (Anti-cheat: Random "Check-in" prompts).
- **Reward:**
  - **XP:** Level up your pet.
  - **Health:** Keep your pet alive.
  - **Happiness:** Unlock special animations.

### 2. The Decay System (Retention Hook) 📉

Consistency is key. If you slack off, your pet suffers.

- **Daily Hunger:** Your pet loses **10 Health** every 24 hours.
- **Neglect:**
  - **< 50 Health:** Pet visually changes (Sad/Sick). Interaction limited.
  - **0 Health:** Pet becomes **"Dormant"**. It cannot gain XP or earn rewards until revived.
- **The "Snap" Mechanic:** If you miss 3 days in a row, your pet drops a Level. Keep your streak alive!

### 3. Evolution & Status 🧬

Pets aren't just static images. They evolve based on your long-term dedication.

## 🤝 Social Layer (Viral Growth)

FocusPet is built to be played _together_.

### 1. "Pet Dates" (Social Casting)

- **Cast Action:** Cast your pet to a friend's feed using a Frame.
- **Interaction:** If they interact back, both pets "Play".
- **Benefit:** Boosts **Happiness** for both + Bonus XP.

### 2. Accountability Circles

- Form a **"Pack"** (Group of 3-5 users).
- **Pack Bonus:** If _everyone_ in the pack completes their daily focus, the whole group gets a **1.5x XP Boost**.
- **Peer Pressure:** If one person misses, the bonus is lost for everyone.

### 3. Leaderboards

- **"Deep Work Beast":** Most hours focused this week.
- **"Streak Master":** Longest active daily streak.
